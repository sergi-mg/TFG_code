This repository contains the Python code developed during my Final Degree Project of my Bachelor's degree in Physics at Universitat de Barcelona: 
Analysis of a Greedy Algorithm for Segregation Minimization in Schellingâ€™s Model; being my advisor Dr. Emanuele Cozzo. The code contains
the functions needed to apply the greedy algorithm to Schelling's model in a 2D square lattice and to analyse the results obtained. Apart
from that, there is also some lines of code showing how to write and read the files with the data generated.
